# Simple Text-to-Speech App

_Use Markdown to organize and communicate project ideas for developing a text-to-speech application._

## Project Overview

The Text-to-Speech App is designed to convert written text into spoken words using a speech synthesis library. This project will provide an interface where users can input text and listen to the generated speech.

## Features

- **User Interface**: A simple text area for inputting text and a play button to initiate speech.
- **Voice Options**: Multiple voice choices for different languages and accents.
- **Playback Controls**: Options to pause, resume, and stop the speech.

## Example Code Snippet

Below is an example in Python using the `pyttsx3` library for text-to-speech conversion:

``` python
import pyttsx3

def text_to_speech(text):
    engine = pyttsx3.init()
    engine.say(text)
    engine.runAndWait()

text_to_speech("Hello, welcome to the text-to-speech app!") ```
